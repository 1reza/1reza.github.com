Summary:  A quick summary of Kevin Richardson.  

My goal is to create beautiful software that assists users in living a better life.  Applications without a focus distract users from completing their tasks efficiently and hinder their ability to live a life in the real world.  Although I have interests in many areas of computer science, programming, and development (as well as in life itself), my current interests focus on creating responsive and intelligent applications with an intention of simplifying (rather than increasing) the amount of work a person has to complete to get things done.  Computers are very good at repeating boring or complicated tasks, so we should harness that power to make lives better.

I urge you to consider releasing your own software or other creations under similar licenses so others can benefit from your accomplishments and the world can be a better place.

Currently, I work predominantly in the [Django web framework](http://djangoproject.com) and the [Python](http://www.python.org/) language but have experience with a variety of languages and frameworks.  Ultimately, I want to create wonderful experiences for users and will learn whichever langauges or tools are neccessary.

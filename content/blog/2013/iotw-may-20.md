Summary: A collection of interesting items for the week of May 20, 2013.  


* [Django CMS](https://www.django-cms.org) -- My group has been tasked with conjoining my company's plethora of websites under a single, CMS-powered website to reduce confusion among customers and unify the company's branding presence. As many of the sites currently use the fantastic [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework and the team greatly enjoys using it, we wanted to find an extension to the framework that would fit the needs of the project. To that end, Django CMS seems to fit the bill incredibly well. If interested, I suggest you [try out Django CMS's demo](https://demo.django-cms.org/).
* [Zombies, Run!](https://www.zombiesrungame.com/) (5k Training) -- In this augmented reality app, you enter a postapocalytic world as Runner 5, an individual tasked with walking and running over a zombie-ridden landscape in search of supplies that allow your outpost to continue its existence. As mentioned on the app's website, "Over the course of an eight week, 25 workout training [program], youâ€™re trained to help collect supplies and protect the town from the encroaching zombie apocalypse." The application syncs to Zombielink, a web app allowing you to view a plethora of information about your sessions, including distance covered, time ellapsed, and a map of the the route you've taken.
* [Formula D](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37904/formula-d) -- A boardgame in which the players take on the role of professional racecar drivers pushing their vehicles to the limit "[...] on the most challenging tracks the world has ever seen." I've only played the game once so far but certainly look forward to future sessions. You might be interested in seeing the gameplay as [featured on TableTop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSYEoP0j63c).
* [Call of the Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_the_Wild) by Jack London -- A novel set at the time of the 19th-century Klondike Gold Rush that explores a dog's return to his primal nature. This book was a very short and enjoyable read and has a [free Kindle edition](http://www.amazon.com/Call-Wild-ebook/dp/B0083ZBW2Y/) (as well as many other free editions, such as [this one on Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215)).

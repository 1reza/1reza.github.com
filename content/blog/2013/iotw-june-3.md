Summary: A collection of interesting items for the week of June 3, 2013.  

* [Processing payments for the paranoid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYXqbkHMj6k) -- In this recording of a talk from [DjangoCon EU 2013](http://2013.djangocon.eu/), Andy McKay shares discoveries he has made while creating the payment processing structure behind Mozilla's [Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/). Among other things, he advocates restricting access to payment provider credentials as much as possible (through several layers of services) because the largest source of vulnerability is often ourselves.
* [AngularJS Fundamentals in 60-ish Minutes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM) -- This 70 minute video provides a fantastic introduction to [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and its various components. Furthermore, the creator suggests a project structure that helped me understand the components in more detail.
* [AngularJS-Learning](https://github.com/jmcunningham/AngularJS-Learning) -- This GitHub repository contains links to various websites and other resources for learning AngularJS.
* [Animal Crossing: New Leaf](http://animal-crossing.com/newleaf/) -- Although this Nintendo 3DS game has only been available since this morning at midnight, I'm having a great time and look forward to learning more about the inhabitants of my virtual island paradise.

Summary: A collection of interesting items for the week of April 1, 2013.

* [Clojure in Action](http://www.manning.com/rathore/) by Amit Rathore. I've found this book much easier to read and understand than both [Clojure Programming](http://www.clojurebook.com/) and [Programming Clojure](http://pragprog.com/book/shcloj/programming-clojure) as it seems to offer a much better high-level explanations of the language and how it fits into the JVM ecosystem.

* [AngularJS Directives and The Computer Science of JavaScript](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/angularjs-directives-and-the-computer-science-of-javascript.html) -- This article offers a nice introduction to [AngularJS's directives](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive), a way to "teach HTML new tricks."

* [Imperative vs Declarative](http://latentflip.com/imperative-vs-declarative/) -- An explanation of imperative vs. declarative programming paradigms. Imperative programming is telling the machine *how* to do something and declarative programmign is telling the machine *what* you would like to happen and allowing it to figure out the specific steps. It uses map/reduce functions, SQL, and d3.js to discuss how declarative programming abstracts away the specifics the programmer will focus on while using imperative programming.
* [The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword](http://www.zelda.com/skywardsword/) -- I am absolutely loving this game except for how it continually reminds the player of the function of items she just picked up…

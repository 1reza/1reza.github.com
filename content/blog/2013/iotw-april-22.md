Summary: A collection of interesting items for the week of April 22, 2013.  

* [Jrnl](maebert.github.io/jrnl/) -- Jrnl is "[…] a simple journal application for your command line" written in Python that saves to text files and [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) journals. According to the site, "a journal helps you to keep track of the things you get done and how you did them" and a good starting place is to make a habit of writing at least 20 words per day. I've been using [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) to maintain my work journal over the past year but have found it sometimes inconveniencing to switch to the nvALT window when I want to compose. Because I spend a large majority of my time with a terminal as the focused window, I believe I'm going to see if jrnl works better. To setup jrnl with my Day One journal, I had to add the following to the journals object of my `.jrnl` configuration file:  `"default": "/Users/kevin/Dropbox/Apps/Day One/Journal.dayone"`.
* [Taskwarrior](http://taskwarrior.org/projects/show/taskwarrior) -- Although [Trello](https://trello.com/) is a wonderful tool I've been greatly appreciating for quite some time (especially to track work tasks in Kanban-like fashion), I often find myself wanting a much simpler list tool for my personal tasks and quick notes. From what I can tell based off my usage of it over the past week, Taskwarrior fulfills my requirements very well. Installation on OS X is very easy:  merely install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) and run `brew install task`. For more information, check out its [30-second tutorial](http://taskwarrior.org/projects/taskwarrior/wiki/30-second_Tutorial).
* [Fargo](fargo.io/) -- Fargo is a lovely web-based outliner from [Dave Winer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer) and [Kyle Shank](http://www.kyleshank.com/) that syncs with Dropbox. I need to look more into this over the upcoming week.
* [My Pacific Crest Trail Moleskine Journals](http://www.thehikeguy.com/2011/11/10/pct-moleskines/) -- In this blog entry from 2011, the author shares a multitude of image scans and stories from the journals he kept while hiking the [Pacific Crest Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail). It's intriguing to see how the author's journals change over time as he learns what information he desires to track the most. I also appreciate how he shares his reasoning for keeping the journals:  "I would use my journal to define problems I would experience on the trail and come up with options for trying to solve the problem. […] Keeping a journal helps me define my main goal as well as daily goals I would make."

Summary: A collection of interesting items for the week of March 18, 2013.

* [AngularJS for jQuery Developers](http://blog.artlogic.com/2013/03/06/angularjs-for-jquery-developers/) -- A very brief introduction to [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org). I particularly enjoyed its Dependency Injection overview.
* [Superhero.js](http://superherojs.com/) -- "[…] a continously updated list of articles that help explain the syntax of JavaScript, how to organize your projects, how to test your code, and what's on the horizon."
* [Effective JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-JavaScript-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0321812182/) -- This book offers concise and digestible pieces of advice on JavaScript development. I highly recommend it if you'd like to further your understanding of the language.
* [FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/Mikkeren/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) -- …yep…
* [How to Live on 24 Hours a Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Live_on_24_Hours_a_Day) -- Advice on how to live and not merely exist.

Summary: A collection of interesting items for the week of May 27, 2013.  

* [The Open Source Report Card](http://osrc.dfm.io/) -- "Enter a GitHub username to see a dynamically generated progress report for their open source contributions." For example, [my open source report card](http://osrc.dfm.io/kfr2) discusses my interest in Python as well as GitHub users who have similar work patterns.
* [Gitray](http://gitray.com/) -- A webapp allowing the user to easily navigate projects hosted on GitHub via a file tray similar to that of Sublime Text. For an example, view the [Gitray of cmsplugin-biography](http://gitray.com/kfr2/cmsplugin-biography).
* [Folium](https://github.com/wrobstory/folium) -- A Python library for integrating with the [Leaflet JavaScript library](http://leafletjs.com/) that produces mobile-friendly, interactive maps. The library supports filesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, Stamen, and Cloudmade. Check out the project's page for a plethora of fantastic-looking example maps.
* [Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/zp2Ns75itEVaf0PoEIyv49f2MEBspSeA) -- This game for the Nintendo 3DS is a revamp of the Wii's Donkey Kong Country Returns. I'm enjoying how the game takes very minimal investment (as the levels don't take very long to complete) while looking fantastic.

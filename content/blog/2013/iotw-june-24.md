Summary: A collection of interesting items for the week of June 24, 2013.  

* [Newsblur](https://newsblur.com/) -- With [Google Reader's impending shutdown on July 1](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html), I had a need to find a service for handling the RSS feeds to which I am subscribed. For a while, [Feedly](http://cloud.feedly.com/#welcome) was intriguing but I eventually found myself wanting something more similar to the experience which [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) has offered to me over the past couple of years. To that end, [this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5958407) on Hacker News filled me with enough curiosity to subscribe to Newsblur for a year and I have not yet been disappointed. Although I'm not yet sure how much I will use the feature, Newsblur allows its users to share stories in a [blurblog](http://kfr2.newsblur.com/).
* [Readkit](http://readkitapp.com/) -- ReadKit is an OS X application for reading saved content from a plethora of services, including [Readability](http://readability.com/), [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in), [Newsblur](http://newsblur.com), and more. As it offers an interface very similar to Reeder, I have been greatly enjoying the application and look forward to consuming a large volume of information through it.
* [Startup Engineering](https://class.coursera.org/startup-001) -- Startup Engineering is a Coursera course that "[covers] modern software engineering principles with a focus on mobile HTML5 development" and will bring the concepts to life by sharing real engineering problems from the work of "top Silicon Valley startups (including Uber, Coinbase, Meteor, Square, Stripe, AirBnb, Twilio, Taskrabbit, Judicata, Counsyl, Twitter, and Asana". I'm very excited to complete this course for both for its theory as well as the chance it provides to become more acquainted with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

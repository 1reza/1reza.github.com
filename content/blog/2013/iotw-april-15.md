Summary: A collection of interesting items for the week of April 15, 2013.

* [You should blog even if you have no readers](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you-should-blog-even-if-you-have-no-readers.html) -- Two main reasons: writing makes you a better reader and writing makes you smarter.
* [Forecast](http://forecast.io) -- A beautiful and incredibly functional weather web app that is very likely the (best) mobile weather application. The "installation process" for iOS is incredibly easy in Safari: you merely load forecast.io in Safari and follow the instructions.
* [Garmoshka](http://artpolikarpov.github.io/garmoshka/) -- Resize your browser window to "play" the accordion.
* [Song of GitHub](http://song-of-github.herokuapp.com/) -- Convert a person's GitHub commit history into a MIDI using [MIDI.js](http://mudcu.be/midi-js/). For an example, check out [my Song of GitHub](http://song-of-github.herokuapp.com/?username=kfr2).
* [Nintendo 3DS XL](https://www.nintendo.com/3ds/features/) -- Although I greatly enjoyed the regular 3DS, the XL's matte finish feels and looks fantastic (and doesn't get incredibly covered with fingerprints to boot). The increased screen sizes are also very appealing.

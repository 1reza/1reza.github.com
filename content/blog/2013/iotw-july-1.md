Summary: A collection of interesting items for the week of July 1, 2013.  

* [WiFi on your Raspberry Pi](http://pingbin.com/2012/12/setup-wifi-raspberry-pi/) -- Having recently acquired a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), I was interested in connecting it to my LAN over WiFi so as to reduce cable clutter while being able to access it via SSH or X Forwarding. This article discusses a very low cost USB WiFi card as well as how to enable it. [This guide](http://www.savagehomeautomation.com/projects/raspberry-pi-installing-the-edimax-ew-7811un-usb-wifi-adapte.html) was also very helpful.
* [How to enable X11 Forwarding with SSH on Mac OS X](http://dyhr.com/2009/09/05/how-to-enable-x11-forwarding-with-ssh-on-mac-os-x-leopard/) -- After enabling X11 Forwarding in the remote machine's `sshd_config` file, login to the machine with `ssh -Y user@host`. After login, run the desired command. Very awesome!
* [PyOhio](http://pyohio.org/) -- PyOhio is a free Python conference in Columbus, OH. This year, the event occurs on July 27th and 28th and has a plethora of interesting [talks](http://pyohio.org/schedule/talks/list/) and [tutorials](http://pyohio.org/schedule/tutorials/list/).

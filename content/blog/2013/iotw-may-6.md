Summary: A collection of interesting items for the week of May 6, 2013.  

* [Know Your HTTP!](https://github.com/bigcompany/know-your-http) -- If you're looking for some informational posters for your home or office, Know Your HTTP offers a collection of posters describing HTTP methods, status codes, and headers. As an added bonus, the posters are licensed under the [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) so they may be transformed and shared as long as they're used for noncommercial purposes.
* [Aqua Theme](https://github.com/cafarm/aqua-theme) -- Aqua Theme is a UI theme for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) with a goal of making the application feel more native on OS X. It comes with both light and dark variations as well as four syntax highlighting color schemes (Espresso Aqua, Tomorrow Aqua, Monokai Aqua, and Tomorrow Night Aqua).
* [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) -- I really love [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), a tool that allows one to easily create complete development environments via virtual machines. It's very useful because, among other reasons, it lets the user create an environment that will be totally isolated from others. Vagrant-vbguest is a plugin for Vagrant which "automatically installs the host's VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest system" upon boot of the VM. It's very useful because issues may arise if the Guest Additions versions do not match across host and guest.
* [Try Foundation](http://www.tryfoundation.io) -- Try Foundation provides interactive lessons designed to assist the user in learning [ZURB Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), a front-end HTML/CSS framework analogous to [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/). The lessons include inline code editing with automatically updated output as well as many examples from which one can glean information.
* [Epic Citadel HTML5](http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/) -- Epic Citadel is a demonstration of the [Unreal Engine](http://www.unrealengine.com/en/) ported to HTML5 via WebGL and JavaScript (with benefits from [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/), a very optimized subset of JavaScript). The site recommends you run the demo in [Firefox Nightly](http://nightly.mozilla.org/), although I've had no issues with [Firefox Aurora](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/#aurora).
* [Throne of the Crescent Moon](http://www.amazon.com/Throne-Crescent-Moon-Kingdoms-ebook/dp/B0064VQDHI/) -- This sword-and-sorcery novel has interesting characters with a rich setting. I look forward to exploring it more during the upcoming week.
